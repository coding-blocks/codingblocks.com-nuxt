              The course will help you become smarter with solutions and ace your programming interviews. C++ is known to be a very powerful language. It allows you to have a lot of control as to how you use computer resources effectively and efficiently better than other languages. Thanks to C++'s performance, it is often used to develop game engines, games, and desktop apps. As a statically typed language, C++ generally does better than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked before it is executed. Companies like Google and Facebook, also need C++ developers to optimize their apps or work on their products.

      answer:
        'Anybody who is interested in learning C++ programming can do this course. C++ is a powerful language and is pretty easy to learn. Coding in its most essential form is nothing but problem solving. It deals with figuring out logical solutions and implementing them optimally. The process of learning to code transforms a person into an analytical thinker with strong mathematical and logical skills.'
