            <p>Dear Students,</p>

            <p>
              My name is Manmohan, a programmer, mathematician and above all a learner. I thought this would be
              the perfect time to share with you my idea and the vision behind Coding Blocks. Coding is the
              most in-demand skill of the twenty first century. People known to possess this skill command the
              world and are often more successful than their peers. Many people think coding can be mastered
              only by geniuses who have some supernatural intelligence levels but I must tell you, you donâ€™t
              need to be a genius to learn how to code; only determination is required.
            </p>

            <p>
              We at Coding Blocks strongly believe that with the right guidance and perfect determination, any
              student willing to learn programming can become a master of coding. All team members at Coding
              Blocks are aces of their respective field and the share the highest level of commitment towards
              quality teaching and student success and satisfaction. The present structure of computer
              education in colleges and universities is not aligned to the needs of the IT Industry. Students
              have no place to go and bridge this huge gap. It was this realization that prompted me to
              address this very real need of the student community. Coding Blocks was started as a learning
              centre where we teach fundamentals of programming to college students. The courses here are
              designed to help students with their curriculum and give them a real feel of the IT industry. In
              the last three years, we have helped more than 7200 students achieve their goal and made them
              the darling of the industry. At Coding Blocks, all our instructors are themselves great coders
              and highly employable in the Industry. They decided to join Coding Blocks instead of lucrative
              jobs in the industry because they are passionate about teaching and strongly believe in the
              company's vision.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether you are a student just out of school, a college/university student, a working
              professional planning to switch domain to Software/IT, or just someone wanting to enhance your
              coding skills, I welcome you to join Coding Blocks. Basis your knowledge and skill, we will
              carve out a learning path for you and would guide you to become a great programmer. Wishing you
              success and achievement in your career.
            </p>

          <h4>Create More Employable Talent</h4>
          <p>
            Coding Blocks was founded in 2014 with a mission to create skilled Software Engineers for our country
            and the world. We are here to bridge the gap between the quality of skills demanded by industry and
            the quality of skills imparted by conventional institutes.
          </p>

          <h4>Make People Fall in Love with Coding</h4>
          <p>
            Programming is a lot of fun because, unlike other subjects, you get to instantly apply the concepts
            you are learning. At Coding Blocks, we strive to increase student interest by providing hands on
            practical training on every concept taught in the classroom.
          </p>

          <h4>Unlock New Opportunities</h4>
          <p>
            We create confident developers who think beyond industrial jobs and march their ideas into
            self-created entrepreneurship ventures. Skill and innovative thinking give developers the confidence
            to transform their ideas into real life products and hopefully go on to build million dollar
            companies.
          </p>

          <h4>Connect Talent with Employers</h4>
          <p>
            Along with training students with the latest technologies and programming languages, we also connect
            them to software companies via our placement assistance program. This program includes practicing a
            lot of interview problems and mock interviews conducted by company representatives.
